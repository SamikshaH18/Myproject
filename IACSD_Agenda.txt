Principles

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
			through early and continuous delivery
			  e.g.
	focus on user story not on use case

	24 hours ----a simple web site with product list display
	next 24 hours---- product details by clicking product from list
	next 24 hours---- allow customer to select product and
					          add to cart
	mext 24 hours----shopping cart managment
				add from cart
				update item inside the cart maintained
				remove item from cart
				of valuable software. (Online shopping portal)


2.Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. 
  Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

		Customer suggested facebook, gmail, yahoo authentication to onlineshopping web site
		Team will implement Federated authentication (Single Sign On)
		Integrate payment gateway for visa, master card   now Rupay

3.Deliver working software frequently, 
	from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, 
	with a preference to the shorter timescale.
	
	36 Days project implementation of Online shopping portal	
	define 4 days Sprint-------------plan, design, develop, test, deploy (demo)---product catalog
	define 4 days Sprint-------------plan, design, develop, test, deploy (demo)---shopping Cart
	define 4 days Sprint-------------plan, design, develop, test, deploy (demo)---authentication
	define 4 days Sprint-------------plan, design, develop, test, deploy (demo)---orderprocessing
	define 4 days Sprint-------------plan, design, develop, test, deploy (demo)---payment processinh
	define 4 days Sprint-------------plan, design, develop, test, deploy (demo)---authorization
	define 4 days Sprint-------------plan, design, develop, test, deploy (demo)---delivery
	define 4 days Sprint-------------plan, design, develop, test, deploy (demo)---CRM
	define 4 days Sprint-------------plan, design, develop, test, deploy (demo)---BI

4.Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
	stakholder, owner of business, 
	Team:
		team leader, 
		designer, 
		developer (front end dev, core business Dev, Spring MVC, boot dev, database develoer)
		Tester ( )
		IT Operations

5.	Build projects around motivated individuals.
	Give them the environment and support they need,
	and trust them to get the job done.
		Customer------user story-----------------------
		Team leader---enviornment, resources -----machines, guidlines,etc.
		Developer---- using proper development toolsm,
		Tester-------- tools
		team---------- jira

6. 	The most efficient and effective method of conveying information 
		to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.	
	Everday shedule 10 minutes meeting---------------standup meeting-----iterative meeting
	Every weekend  spring meeting--------------------incremental meeting-
							 retrospection
7.	Working software is the primary measure of progress.
			Each time customer will be able to explore working software as delivarable
			
8.	Agile processes promote sustainable development.
	The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9.	Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10.	Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

11.	The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12.	At regular intervals,   ( Sprint) 
	the team reflects 
	on how to become more effective, 
	then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

 Agile Implementation:

	Using Waterfall model project fail......
			rate of failure is high--------
			80-20 Rule    //paretto principle

	Using Agile project do not  fail.
			
	Agile does not fail, We do.

		We fail to fully embrace the manifesto and its principles
		We fail to transform our mindset aroung how work is done.
		We fail to properly implment the tries and proven practices.
		We fail to commit and preserve.


	Success is possible.
	Transformation takes time
		Be consistent,
		   persistent,
		   intentional


	seek help----- you will need it.

Scrum:
	Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations 
					      generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.
